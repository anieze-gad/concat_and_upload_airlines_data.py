# Airlines On-time Performance Data Consolidation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project features a Python script, `concat_and_upload_airlines_data.py`, designed to streamline the preprocessing of Airlines On-time Performance data. The script concatenates multiple monthly dataset files into a unified DataFrame using pandas and uploads the resulting dataset to a **PostgreSQL database** via SQLAlchemy for subsequent analysis. This automation enhances efficiency in handling large-scale flight data, making it ready for SQL-based insights.
